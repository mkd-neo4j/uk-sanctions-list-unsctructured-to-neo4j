## Directory Purpose

This directory serves as the input source for PDF documents containing UK sanctions data that will be:
1. Converted to text format
2. Processed by LLM extraction modules
3. Structured into Neo4j graph database entities

## File Organization

PDF files in this directory should follow these conventions:
- Use descriptive names that indicate the sanctions category (e.g., `Cyber.pdf`, `Terrorism.pdf`)
- Maintain original PDF format for archival purposes
- Document metadata and processing notes in this README when adding new files

## Processing Workflow

1. PDF files are processed by `pdf_to_text.py` for text extraction
2. Extracted text is analyzed by LLM modules for entity recognition
3. Structured data is imported into Neo4j for graph analysis

## Notes

- PDF documents are typically generated from official UK government sanctions lists
- Files may be updated periodically as sanctions lists change
- Always verify document authenticity and source before processing
